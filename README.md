# High-Fi Prototype - AchieveLab

A collaborative platform to help goal-achieving.


## **1. Project Summary**


People face difficulties keeping self promises because there are no visible penalty, no social responsibility, and no external motivation. We are going to address this problem by forming teams of users with similar goals and interests to build social responsibility, common ground, and will provide visible penalty and external motivation to users to help achieve their goals through competition. Specifically, we use a social credit system and team versus team system to do so.


## **2. Instruction**
“Social Credit” is a currency used in the AchieveLab app. Users pay a deposit to join challenges, and get them back (with bonuses) when they succeed after a week. Users are given tiers based on this. A “Team Point” is a measure of the combined user contribution within a team. Teams are ranked by “Team Point”.

1) Team Main Page: Users can check their progress, update their progress, and talk to other members for team building.
2) Select Interest Page: Users can pick a goal of their choice. For the prototype version, only “Waking up early” is selectable. 
3) Team Select Page: Users can select a team of their choice to join. For the prototype, users are only able to join the “Achievelab team.”
4) Profile Page: Users can see their social credit, rank, and the teams they are joining
5) Leaderboard: Leaderboard shows all teams that are currently participating in the goal, motivating the teams to get first place.
